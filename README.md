# mkstrz-plugin
This plugin uses CSS heavily to change the look and feel of the standard WordPress theme. It's aim is to streamline, beautify, and improve aesthetically working in the WordPress backend. It does this through CSS, as well as functions to remove menu items, nag, notices, upsells, red notification cirles. It seems everyone today wants to upsell you on something. "Get the pro version" You probably have heard this a million times. And it's not fun when you are trying to do basical web developing when you're attention gets pulled in every direction. 

Because of the constant stream of upsells and nags, as long as I work on the WordPress platform, which is for the forseeable future, this plugin will constantly be updated. 

A note: Everyone is using different tools, there will never be a plugin that can keep up with all the upsells and nags. So my advice is to take this plugin, ditch what you don't like, and add what works for you. It is usually a very indiviual preference. 

The codebase is pretty crude. Not sophisticated. But it does the job. Also for Divi users out there, it modifies the Divi backed builder which is usally confined to a small tiny little UI, and it makes it full screen by default. Again, like I said, to your preference. You may not be a Divi dev. 

If anything, let the plugin be a inspirtation for you to create something like it for yourself.

Steal it, mod it, make money from a version of it. I care not. Just want to make WordPress developing a little better for everyone.
